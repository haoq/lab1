        <h1>Jay Gatsby</h1>

        <p> 
        <em>James Gatz</em>, better known as Jay Gatsby, is the title character of F. Scott Fitzgerald's best known work, The Great Gatsby (1925). The character has become an archetype of self-made American men seeking to join high society, and in the U.S., the name has become synonymous with those successful businessmen who have had shady pasts.
